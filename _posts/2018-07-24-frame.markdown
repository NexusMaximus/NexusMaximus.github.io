In this initial post, I will be playing with different things that can be done in markdown and detailing exactly how to do them. Virtually all of the content here is taken directly from [the Jekyll post writing docs][jekyll-post-docs], but I wanted to create a cheatsheet briefly summarizing what I think is the most helpful content.

I also found a generic markdown cheatsheet [here][cheatsheet] but some things mentioned there don't appear to work. Another Jekyll-specific cheatsheet can be found [here][cheatsheet2] but it's not super comprehensive. 

Formatting text
===============

Inserting: code snippets

Inserting: links

These require two lines of stuff:

{% highlight c %}
yadda yadda [link text][link tag] blah blah blahblah
// at bottom of doc, place this as is:
[link tag]: http://yourlinkhere.whatever/whatever
{% endhighlight %}



Inserting: pictures



Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
