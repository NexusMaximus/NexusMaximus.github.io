"Now, to get good at writing posts, I must figure out HOW to write posts in the first place." -- Kyle B to self

Welcome to my first technical blog entry! This post will function as a technical cheatsheet for how to write posts. 
Much of the content here is taken directly from [the Jekyll docs about writing docs][jekyll-post-docs], but I wanted to create a cheatsheet briefly summarizing what I think is the most helpful content.

I found a generic markdown cheatsheet [here][cheatsheet] but some things mentioned there don't appear to work in this specific environment. Another Jekyll-specific cheatsheet can be found [here][cheatsheet2] but it's not super comprehensive-- thus the need for this post here. I'll be adding to it continuously over the next few days (probably weeks) as I learn more and more about what's possible and as I test my markdown, so if it seems a little small or improperly formatted, you know why. 

## Formatting text

## Comments

## Inserting: code snippets

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

created with:

```
{% raw %}
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
```

## Posting raw/verbatim code blocks
This one took me a while to figure out. Encapsulate your stuff as follows but remove the spaces on the closing tag, and replace the double-triple-double backticks with just triple backticks (tricking the parser is hard and I'm not good at it yet).

```
{% raw %}
`` ``` `` 
{% raw %}
put your raw 
code stuff here
{ % endraw % }
`` ``` ``
{% endraw %}
```

## Inserting: links

These require two lines of stuff:

{% highlight c %}
yadda yadda [link text][link tag] blahblah
//OR
yadda yadda [link text](http://yourlinkhere.com/GettingGood) blahblah
// at bottom of doc, place this as is:
[link tag]: http://yourlinkhere.com/GettingGood
{% endhighlight %}



## Inserting: pictures
