This post is a technical cheatsheet for syntactical constructs used to create pretty posts, specifically in the Jekyll/Github Pages environment. 
Much of the content here is taken directly from [the Jekyll docs about writing docs][jekyll-post-docs], but I wanted to create a cheatsheet briefly summarizing what I think is the most helpful content.

I found a generic markdown cheatsheet [here][cheatsheet] but some things mentioned there don't appear to work in this specific environment. Another Jekyll-specific cheatsheet can be found [here][cheatsheet2] but it's not super comprehensive-- thus the need for this post here. 
Yet another link [here](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet) proved itself very helpful in the creation of this cheatsheet, too. 
[Wordpress official quick reference](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/) has good info too.
I'll be adding to it continuously over the next few days (probably weeks) as I learn more and more about what's possible and as I test my markdown, so if it seems a little small or improperly formatted, you know why. 

## Formatting text

To create headers, use pounds symbols/hashtags. 

# One pound

``` # One pound ```

Question: Why does one pound result in smaller text than two? I don't know yet. 

## Two pounds

```## Two pounds```

### Three pounds

```### Three pounds```

#### Four pounds

```#### Four pounds```

##### Five pounds

```##### Five pounds```

###### Six pounds

```###### Six pounds```


Italics: _italic text here_

``` _italic text here_ ```
or
``` *italic text here* ```

Bold/Emphasis: **bold text here**

``` __bold text here__ ```
or
``` **bold text here** ```

Combine the two: **B/I text _here_**

``` **B/I text _here_** ```

## Lists
```
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
  * Bullet 2a
    * Bullet 2b
* Bullet 3
```
Renders as:
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
  * Bullet 2.1
    * Bullet 2.1.1
* Bullet 3


```
1. item 1
2. item 2
	1. Item 2a
3. item 3
```
Renders as:

1. item 1
2. item 2
	1. item 2a
3. item 3

Sadly, it seems that [markdown doesn't support numbered sublists](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/85474/how-to-write-nested-numbered-lists) (such as 1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3, etc).  


## Markdown Comments

To make a single line markdown comment:

``` [/]: comment here ```

[//]: comment here
Note that you may need to add some blank lines above or below to get the comment to register as a comment. Also, I don't know why but things like ``` [asdf/]: comment text here``` register properly as comments too. 

To make a multiline markdown comment, HTML comment tags seem to work:

```
<!--- 
line 1 here
line 2 here
...
line X here
-->
```

## Inserting code snippets

Jekyll makes use of something called Liquid to do [templates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4026597/what-is-a-templating-language). It looks like there's about a million and ten things you can do with this and they're all nicely organized on [Jekyll's Liquid docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/), so check that out there. 
If it ends up being super complex, I will write up another post explaining the basics of templating for noobs like myself. 
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

created with:

```
{% raw %}
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
```

## Posting raw/verbatim code blocks
This one took me a while to figure out. Encapsulate your stuff as follows but remove the spaces on the closing tag, and replace the double-triple-double backticks with just triple backticks (tricking the parser is hard and I'm not good at it yet).

```
{% raw %}
`` ``` `` 
{% raw %}
put your raw 
code stuff here
{ % endraw % }
`` ``` ``
{% endraw %}
```

## Inserting links


These require two lines of stuff:

{% highlight c linenos %}
yadda yadda [link text][link tag] blahblah
//OR
yadda yadda [link text](http://yourlinkhere.com/GettingGood) blahblah
// at bottom of doc, place this as is:
[link tag]: http://yourlinkhere.com/GettingGood
{% endhighlight %}



## Inserting pictures

#### Inserting pictures from a link

![sweet pic](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lWOyJ3PiYfI/T_8z4Pl6EGI/AAAAAAAABwA/zjeB2UGEnCQ/s1600/zz.jpeg "caption here")
```![sweet pic](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lWOyJ3PiYfI/T_8z4Pl6EGI/AAAAAAAABwA/zjeB2UGEnCQ/s1600/zz.jpeg "caption here")```


#### Inserting local pictures
Inserting local pictures can be done by identifying the path to the picture (treating the root part of the repo as the 'root' directory). The picture below is called 'zz.jpeg' and is in the 'files' directory. 

![sweet pic]({{"/files/zz.jpeg"}} "caption here")

```![sweet pic]({{"/files/zz.jpeg"}} "caption here")```
