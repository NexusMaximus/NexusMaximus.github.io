Liquid is a templating language used with Jekyll, and it appears to have some significant power. This post will be dedicated to investigating just what's possible using it. I started off by following the docs [here](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/). 


Other resources:
* [simple liquid PoC things](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
* [global/site variable info](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/)


It looks like Liquid will be more helpful when I actually have some content that needs organizing. As such, I'm going to hold off on researching how this works until after I get some more posts.
