In this category of posts, I'll be detailing how I go about answering the end-of-chapter lab questions. There ARE going to be spoilers in the lab towards the end of the post (but I will clearly mark where the spoilers begin). 

I'll also answer the following general questions in an attempt to keep the big picture of the assignments in mind:

1. Considering malware analysis as a whole, how important is it to a general aspiring analyst to complete this chapter's exercises?
2. What did doing the lab exercises teach that was not gained from reading the chapter?
3. What are the three (or more) most notable challenges encountered in doing these exercises, and what did you do to overcome them?
