# Welcome to my blog!

I'm glad you found your way here. This blog will be an organized hub for everything technical that I write, set up, or figure out over the course of the next year that I am working on my thesis.
It'll revolve around reverse engineering malware, but may also include instructables that set up environments, programs, or other misc. CS-related content that is interesting enough to spend some time on. It is my goal, once I've began the Fall 2018 semester, to post at least one technical blog a week to keep me learning. 

Questions? Comments? Recommendations? Great! I still haven't figured out how to integrate a comments mechanism onto this blog yet (although it is on my list), so send me a message on Twitter @KyleTheReverser and I'll get back to you. 

Cheers!
