I'm glad you found your way here. This blog will be an organized hub for everything technical that I write, set up, or figure out over the course of my final year in graduate school. 
It'll revolve around reverse engineering malware, but may also include instructables that set up environments, programs, notes,
or other miscellaneous CS-related content that is interesting enough to spend some time on. 

Questions? Comments? Recommendations? Great! Until I get comments working on my blog, send me a message on Twitter @KyleTheReverser and Iâ€™ll get back to you.

Thank you for reading!
